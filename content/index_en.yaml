  **_esUNIX_ is a consulting company** whose job is to follow your
  infrastructures design and implementation projects.

  Over the years, people from _esUNIX_ have dealt with hundreds of highly
  available and sensitive environments such as **network operators**,
  **hosting companies** or even global VoIP platforms.

md_history: |
  We, at _esUNIX_, are fond of UNIX and Linux systems. For 15+ years we've
  been dealing with UNIX and Linux environments such as [Debian][1] GNU/Linux,
  [RedHat][2], [NetBSD][3], [FreeBSD][4], [OpenBSD][5], or [Solaris][6]
  and [SunOS][7] derivatives. We have a strong expertise on making these
  Operating Systems scalable and responsive.

  Not only we know their very core, we also participated in their
  evolution by programming some of their components or have provided some
  comprehensive documentation regarding their inner properties.

md_expertise: |
  Let's be clear: [Cloud Computing][1] is all about UNIX and Linux, so it is
  very naturally that our expertise has grown strong and solid over the years on
  Virtualization, and implicitely, the Cloud.

  [Amazon Web Services][2] have made a magnificent work on making [Xen][3],
  the virtualization technology it is built on, ready for the masses. We at
  _esUNIX_, have a deep understanding on what **AWS** is about, and how to
  create an optimized & scalable infrastructure in the Cloud.

  * **AWS** highly available architectures: [Route 53][1] multi-region failover,
    cost & speed optimization through [CloudFront][2], [MultiAZ][3],
    [AutoScaled][4] and [Load Balanced][5] architectures, all in a secure,
    [PCI/DSS][6] enabled environment

  * Architectures from scratch: multi-homed _BGP_ routing, highly available
    switching, firewalling and Load Balancing setups allowing scalable growth.

  * Home made Cloud Platforms, using industry standards, well known, rock solid
    technologies powered by flexible and easy-to-use deployment and
    orchestration mechanisms.

  > Friends don't let friends build datacenters --Charles E. Phillips

md_aws: |
  [Amazon Web Services][1] is the most known and powerful Cloud platform around,
  and you know it _with great power comes great responsibilities_!
  There are many ways of designing an _AWS_ infrastructure, from the simplest
  to the unnecessarily complicated. Our mission: to **fit your needs**.

  _AWS_ is composed of hundreds of services that can be plugged together,
  leading to **thousands** of possible combinations! From basic instances to
  [EC2 Container Service (ECS)][2], [Serverless][3] platforms using
  [Amazon Lambda][4] and the [API Gateway][5] or even massive big data
  workloads using [S3 Athena][6], we can help you pick the tool **you** need.

  You might have your project in mind:

  <ul class="fa-ul skillsitems awsskills">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-truck"></i>**Migrate** your physical
    infrastructure to the Cloud?</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-code-fork"></i>**Extend** / **hybridize** your
    existing infrastructure to the Cloud?</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-star"></i>Start a **brand new** project?</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-rocket"></i>Prepare your existing _AWS_ assets
    for massive traffic or computing needs **growth**?</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-stethoscope"></i>**Audit** an existing
    infrastructure?</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-graduation-cap"></i>**Train** your teams?</li>
  </ul>

  Every one of these requests have an adequate and progressive answer. No need
  for disruption, we have managed the most complex use cases without a second of
  downtime.

  Be reassured, you won't be on your own, not only we will folllow your project,
  but a full deep understanding of the methodologies and techniques used for
  your project setup will be explained, written down and teached to the team in
  charge.

md_devops: |
  What is DevOps? Long story short, DevOps means [R.O.I.][1], the days of the
  mutable infrastructure are gone. With cloud infrastructure and moreover
  ephemeral instances, immutable platforms are the new norm. Get ready to
  put aside chaos and enter the world of predictivity.

  Yet, continuous integration is not as easy as a `git pull`, there must be
  strategy, knowledge and control.

  How does _esUNIX_ fit in? Simple answer: we've been working for all of those.

  <ul class="fa-ul skillsitems unixskills">
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-lightbulb-o"></i>Got an infrastructure in mind
    and need the help of an **experienced professional** to make it happen?</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-stethoscope"></i>Your platform is up and
    running, but either you'd need an **audit** to ensure its viability or you
    need an external eye to find out what's causing those slowdowns?</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-gear"></i>You built it all by yourselves, but in
    an old fashion way, piece by piece not really thinking about
    **industrialization**?</li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-bug"></i>**Debug** an existing script,
    program, component, deployment mechanism?  </li>
    <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-graduation-cap"></i>You might need **training**
    on those new technologies you'd like to use in your project?</li>
  </ul>

  We know Linux, we know UNIX, we are skilled sysadmins and developers, we're
  the **DevOps on stamina**! we can help you on all those areas in a
  professional and progressive way, trust us to be your guide.
