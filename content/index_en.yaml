  **_esUNIX_ is a consulting company** whose job is to follow your
  infrastructures design and implementation projects.

  Over the years, people from _esUNIX_ have dealt with hundreds of highly
  available and sensitive environments such as **network operators**,
  **hosting companies** or even global [VoIP][1] platforms.

md_history: |
  We, at _esUNIX_, are fond of UNIX and Linux systems. For 15+ years we've
  been dealing with UNIX and Linux environments such as [Debian][1] GNU/Linux,
  [RedHat][2], [NetBSD][3], [FreeBSD][4], [OpenBSD][5], or [Solaris][6]
  and [SunOS][7] derivatives. We have a strong expertise on making these
  Operating Systems scalable and responsive.

  Not only we know their very core, we also participated in their
  evolution by programming some of their components or have provided some
  comprehensive documentation regarding their inner properties.

md_expertise: |
  Let's be clear: [Cloud Computing][1] is all about UNIX/Linux, so it is
  very naturally that our expertise has grown strong and solid over the years on
  Virtualization, and implicitely, the Cloud.

  [Amazon Web Services][2] have made a magnificent work on making [Xen][3],
  the virtualization technology it is built on, ready for the masses. We at
  _esUNIX_, have a deep understanding on what **AWS** is about, and how to
  create an optimized & scalable infrastructure in the Cloud.

  * **AWS** highly available architectures: [Route 53][1] multi-region failover,
    cost & speed optimization through [CloudFront][2], [MultiAZ][3],
    [AutoScaled][4] and [Load Balanced][5] architectures, all in a secure,
    [PCI/DSS][6] enabled environment

  * Architectures from scratch: multi-homed _BGP_ routing, highly available
    switching, firewalling and Load Balancing setups allowing scalable growth.

  * Home made Cloud Platforms, using industry standards, well known, rock solid
    technologies powered by flexible and easy-to-use deployment and
    orchestration mechanisms.

md_aws: |
  [Amazon Web Services][1] is the most known and powerful Cloud platform around,
  and you know it _with great power comes great responsibilities_!
  There are many ways of designing an _AWS_ infrastructure, from the simplest
  to the unnecessarily complicated. Our mission: to fit your needs.

  You might have your project in mind:

  * migrate your physical infrastructure to the cloud?
  * extend your existing infrastructure to the Cloud?
  * start a brand new project?
  * prepare your existing _AWS_ assets for massive traffic or computing needs
    growth?

  Every one of these requests have an adequate and progressive answer. No need
  for disruption, we have managed the most complex use cases without a second of
  downtime.

  Be reassured, you won't be on your own, not only we will folllow your project,
  but a full deep understanding of the methodologies and techniques used for
  your project setup will be explained, written down and teached to the team in
  charge.

  UNIX and GNU/Linux are everywhere, phones, watches, TVs, WiFi routers,
  Internet hardware, from the smallest to the biggest companies, UNIX and Linux
  are part of technology's heart.
